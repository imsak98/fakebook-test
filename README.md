## Recreate Docker Containers
Run `docker-compose up -d`

## If Docker is not there
Just have to change the credentials in .env for the mysql and create a db: fakebookdb

## Migrating tables
try loggin in to phpmyadmin by visiting http://localhost:8090/ (this points to the docker container) using creds as username: root, password as rootuserpassword
Note it might take some time to start mysql docker container

after successfully loggin in phpmyadmin start development server


## Development server

Run `npm i`

Run `yarn backend:serve` if you have yarn installed OR `npx nx serve backend` for a dev server.

## Migrations 
goto http://localhost:3333/migrate first time to migrate all the schemas to the db 

## Using Makefile
Run `make build-deploy` to create the docker containers and volumes 
Run `make delete` to delete the docker containers and volumes
